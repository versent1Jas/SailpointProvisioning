See <a href="../help/access_certifications_report_decision_tab.13.6.html" title="Account Group Access Review- Decision Tab">Account Group Access Review- Decision Tab</a>, <a href="../help/access_certifications_report_decision_tab.13.5.html" title="Entitlement Owner Access Review - Decision Tab">Entitlement Owner Access Review - Decision Tab</a> and <a href="../help/access_certifications_report_decision_tab.13.7.html" title="Role Composition Access Review- Decision Tab">Role Composition Access Review- Decision Tab</a>. </div><div id="ww1758837" class="BodyLevel1">Use the Decisions tab to view details on the roles and entitlements granted to the selected identity and any policy violations those entitlements generated. From this page you can take action on the identity’s roles, entitlements and policy violations.</div><div id="ww1741544" class="Note1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 36pt"><span class="GreyBold">Note:	</span></span>For Application Owner access reviews, the Decisions tab only contains information that pertains to the application being certified for the selected identity.</div><div id="ww1741548" class="BodyLevel1">Policies are defined for your enterprise and used to monitor users that are in violation of those policies. For example, a separation of duties policy may disallow one person from requesting and approving purchase orders or an activity policy might disallow a user with the Human Resource role from updating the payroll application. If the policy with which a violation is associated is removed before the violation is acted on in the access review, some policy information might not be available.</div><div id="ww1741552" class="BodyLevel1">Roles are made up of roles and profiles and are defined within IdentityIQ. Profiles are collections of entitlements on one specific application in the business model. An Entitlement is either a specific value for an account attribute, such as group membership, or a permission.</div><div id="ww1741556" class="BodyLevel1">Only the top-level roles are displayed in the roles section. For example, if a role contains required and permitted roles, only the top-level role is displayed and the required and permitted roles are certified as part of that role. Both assigned and detected roles are displayed in the roles section. Different role types are indicated with different icons and you can click the role name to expand the role information and view the role details and hierarchy.</div><div id="ww1754194" class="BodyLevel1">If an identity has a role assigned to it multiple times, that role is displayed multiple times and each one must be reviewed and acted on individually.</div><div id="ww1641073" class="BodyLevel1">Additional entitlements are all entitlements to which the identity has access but that are not included as part of a role to which they have access. If the access review was scheduled with the IdentityIQ capabilities and scope included, these appear as additional entitlements on the IdentityIQ application as Capabilities and Authorized Scopes attributes. Revoking these entitlements has auto-remediation enabled by default. This means that when the revocation is processed (either when the access review is signed or immediately, based on the access review configuration) the capabilities and authorized scopes are removed from the identity.</div><div id="ww1759507" class="BodyLevel1">Changes made to identity information since the last access review was performed are marked with a red [new]. To view details about the changes, click the Recent Changes tab. See <a href="../help/access_certifications_report_recent_tab.html" title="Access Review Page - Recent Changes Tab">Access Review Page - Recent Changes Tab</a>.</div><div id="ww1572896" class="BodyLevel1">To undo a decision, view the decision history or add comments to an access review item, click the icon to the left of the decision buttons. Comments and history are displayed below the summary information for each item. When you are finished reviewing the history and comments, click the close icon. Detail and work item information display in separate dialogs or pages.</div><div id="ww1573165" class="BodyLevel1">The summary section of the access review decision panel is updated with informational messages and warnings about the access review item as well. For example, any item for which a revocation request was generated in a previous access review, but has not been removed from the identity cube displays the following warning, “Item was revoked but has not been removed.” Or, for an item on which an exception was allowed, “Exception allowed until 11/20/2018.”</div><div id="ww1573119" class="BodyLevel1">Identities can have multiple Policy Violations, Roles, and Additional Entitlements.</div><div id="ww1573160" class="BodyLevel1">Use the <span class="Bold">Previous Identity</span> and <span class="Bold">Next Identity</span> buttons to move through the list of identities included in this access review.</div><div id="ww1626776" class="BodyLevel1">If your environment was configured to use paging to limit the display size of the Decision tab sections, you might see the paging controls for each section. Paging controls limit the number of items that display in each section.</div><div id="ww1745899" class="BodyLevel1">Use the <span class="Bold">Approve All</span>, <span class="Bold">Revoke All</span>, and <span class="Bold">Revoke All Accounts</span> buttons to make bulk decisions on the displayed identity. The decisions are not confirmed until you click <span class="Bold">Save Changes</span> or move to a different identity within the access review. This enables you to create exceptions to the bulk decision. For example, for an identity with five roles and thirty additional entitlements you might want to approve all but two of the additional entitlements. Rather than making an individual decision on each of the potentially numerous items in the identity, click <span class="Bold">Approve All</span> and then change the decision for any specific entitlements before saving the decisions.</div><div id="ww1718708" class="BodyLevel1">Bulk decisions overwrite the ability to perform the provisioning of missing required roles from this page. If provisioning was enabled when the certification was scheduled, you can provision roles that are required by roles in the access review but that have not been assigned to the identity.</div><div id="ww1560861" class="BodyLevel1">Use <span class="Bold">Delegate All</span> to delegate the entire identity to a different IdentityIQ user with access review capability.</div><div id="ww1677258" class="BodyLevel1">Use <span class="Bold">Clear Decisions</span> to undo any previous saved or unsaved actions for this portion of the access review.</div><div id="ww1734025" class="BodyLevel1">The Legend defines the choices available from the decisions column. Mouse over an icon in the legend to display a pop-up description.</div><div id="ww1759520" class="BodyLevel1">Click <span class="Bold">Save Changes</span> or <span class="Bold">Cancel Changes</span> at the bottom of the tab to save or cancel any actions taken on this portion of the access review or to suggest the creation of a new role from the additional entitlements on an identity. Use the create new role feature to suggest new roles based on trends found during access reviews. For example, if there are five entitlements that display in the Additional Entitlements list for every identity in a certification, the combination of those entitlements can define a function of that population. Use the <span class="Bold">Create Role </span>button to define a role around that job function and submit it for approval. Then, in the future, you can certify that single role instead of the five additional entitlements.
