Continuous certifications focus on the frequency that individual items need to be certified. Periodic certifications focus on the frequency that the entire certification needs to be completed.</div><div id="ww1670049" class="BodyLevel1">One-off access reviews can be created from the Identity Risk Score, Identity Search Results, or Policy Violation pages. These one-off access reviews can be created for one or more identities. One-off access reviews are most often used in special situations, such as when an access review is required outside of the normal access review cycle.</div><div id="ww1672506" class="BodyLevel1">Certifications can be configured to run based on events that occur within IdentityIQ. For example, IdentityIQ can be configured to automatically generate a certification when an identity's manager changes. You can configure the events that trigger the certifications to meet the needs of your enterprise. After a certification is launched, only specific items within the certification can be modified. The items that can be modified depend upon actions that were taken on the access reviews contained within the certification and the current phase of the certification.</div><div id="ww1672515" class="BodyLevel1"><span class="Bold">Periodic Certification:</span></div><div id="ww1672518" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications are scheduled to run on a periodic basis, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually. These periodic access reviews provide a snapshot view of the identities, roles, and account groups (application object types) within your enterprise. Periodic certifications focus on the frequency at which entire entities (identities, roles, account groups) must be certified.</div><div id="ww1672522" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications are not complete until all access reviews contained within the certification are complete. An access review is not complete until all items, such as roles, entitlements, violations, and application objects, are acted upon and those decision are confirmed by the user to whom that access review was assigned.</div><div id="ww1672307" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications can be created using a multi-level sign-off structure which enables multiple certifiers to review access reviews before they are considered complete. For example, a certification can be created for the direct reports of a business manager who knows his employees, but is not familiar with their accounts and permissions on each application. When the business manager makes his decisions and signs off on the access review, it can be forwarded to the owner of an application to which the employees have access and they can review the decisions and make changes if necessary. </div><div id="ww1672316" class="BodyLevel1"><span class="Bold">Continuous Certification:</span></div><div id="ww1673428" class="BodyLevel1">Continuous certifications focus on the frequency that individual items (roles, entitlements, violations) contained within identity-type certifications need to be certified and not on the frequency that the entire certification needs to be performed. For example, an identity can be assigned accounts on three different applications at different times during their employment within your enterprise. Each of those accounts can require an access review on a quarterly basis. Continuous certification tracks each of those accounts individually and generates an access review required notice for each item as its specific access review becomes due. Continuous certification differs from periodic certifications that focus on the frequency that the entire certification must be performed and not on the frequency that the components need to be certified.</div><div id="ww1673432" class="BodyLevel1">Continuous certifications do not use the sign-off method to track the state of their components. Continuous certifications track the status of each item using certification reports and tasks. Each item in a continuous certification progresses through three stages, certified, certification required, and certification overdue. When an item enters the certification required stage, a notification is sent to the certifier and a work item is sent to their inbox. When the certification is scheduled, the duration of each stage, including their associated notifications and escalations, is defined.</div><div id="ww1673436" class="BodyLevel1">The information within continuous certifications is updated on a regular basis using the Refresh Continuous Certifications task. This ensures that when anything associated with the certification changes the certification information is updated. For example, if an employee leaves the company and they are marked as inactive, the Refresh Continuous Certifications task removes them from the certification. In the same way, if an identity is assigned a new role the task adds that role to the continuous certification. To ensure that items are certified immediately, items are added to a continuous certification using the Refresh Continuous Certification task in the certification required state.</div><footer><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><div class="ww_skin_page_globalization"><div id="google_translate_element">&nbsp;</div><script><!--
