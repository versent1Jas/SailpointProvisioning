***NOTICE*** WE DID EDIT THE EXT SOURCE FILES!!  If you need to patch something (you already tried using 
an override in the ext-patches.js file) in the EXT SOURCE FILES themselves, document your sins here.
Please include a bug number and description of what/where/why/when for tracking.

bug # 15114 - Several issues with strings not being localized as well as other UI issues uncovered during translation
I downloaded ext-4.2.0beta and copied 2 loading text overrides from 4.2 into the ext-4.1.0/locale/ext-lang-de.js, ext-lang-nl.js, 
and ext-lang-fr.js files.  When upgrading to 4.2 we can delete this README file and rely on the ext i18n framework to correctly 
display 'Loading' in language specific locales. So, no need to port this hack over to 4.2.  Changes are: 

    Ext.define("Ext.locale.de.LoadMask", {
        override: "Ext.LoadMask",
        msg: "Lade Daten..."
    });

    // changing the msg text below will affect the LoadMask
    Ext.define("Ext.locale.de.view.AbstractView", {
        override: "Ext.view.AbstractView",
        loadingText: "Lade Daten..."
    });
