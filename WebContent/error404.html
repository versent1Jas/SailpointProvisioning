  Need to add some padding.  If this is less the 512 bytes, IE will not display it but
  instead display the friendly HTTP error page.  This is because the errorthreshold as
  configured in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\ErrorThresholds
  defaults to 512 bytes.  This is a particularly a problem on WebSphere because it generates
  very small 404 error responses.  This only happens when "Show friendly HTTP errors" is
  enabled in IE.
