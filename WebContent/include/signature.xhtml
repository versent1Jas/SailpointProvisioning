<!--
  This is a relatively general include that should be able
  to render any Signature and bind to an attribute map.
  
  This was started for custom risk scores, then expanded to
  custom policies.  Eventually we need to merge this with
  the much more complex signature renderer for task definitions.

  You must pass these parameters:

    signature   - a Signature object
    target      - an object with a Map property "attributes" 
    manageRight - an optional name of a SPRight require to edit the values

  This include will render a table surrounding the signature
  field rows.  If you already have a table and want to merge
  the signature rows into it, include signatureRows.xhtml.
-->
<ui:composition>

  <table style="margin:5px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  
    <ui:include src="signatureRows.xhtml"/>

  </table>
