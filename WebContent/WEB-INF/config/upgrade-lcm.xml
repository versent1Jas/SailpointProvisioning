  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between
  revisions.  

  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and 
  upgradeObjects.xml.  If you have LCM enabled, there are two additional
  files, upgrade-lcm.xml and upgradeObjects-lcm.xml.

  upgrade.xml and upgrade-lcm.xml are processed in a special way before
  Hibernate is started so that changes can be made at the JDBC level.
  These files should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the
  "execute" command to  call upgrader classes.  
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML OR UPGRADE-LCM.XML* 

  upgradeObjects.xml and upgradeObjects-lcm.xml are
  included by upgrade.xml and will be imported after Hibernate is started.
  Any changes to objects that can be respesented as static XML or as
  ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in these files to ensure
  that they are parsed after Hibernate has been started so that
  references can be resolved.  

  Like upgrade.xml, each action should have a revision attribute 
  specified,  which will be checked while upgrading to make sure that
  upgrades aren't run multiple times.  

  First the upgraders that are marked as pre-Hibernate are run, then Hibernate
  is started, then the ones marked as post-Hibernate are run.

  After all the upgraders are run and Hibernate is started, 
  the upgradeObjects-lcm.xml file is imported.

    <!-- DO NOT REMOVE - THIS SHOULD BE IMPORTED FOR EVERY RELEASE. -->
