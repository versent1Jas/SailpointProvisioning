This patch was added to accomodate the fact that we use the prototype javascript library.

The prototype library uses the '$' variable as a shortcut as does jQuery. When we pulled in the jQuery library with the new RichFaces javascript this caused some conflict between the usages.

To fix this we added this patched version of the jQuery library which basically just releases the '$' variable at the end.

We need to do this because we use the '$' variable as a prototype shortcut in our code.
